Idea
======================================
This is suppose to be an example of opengl rendering text with freetype2 on both desktop (linux, osx and windows) and
mobile (android and ios). On mobile it should use opengl es 2.0. On desktop we use GLFW and GLEW to abstract away the
differences between desktop os.

Current status
========================================================
Builds on linux mint.
Can read font and draw text.

======================================
Idea
======================================
This is suppose to be an example of opengl rendering text with freetype2 on both desktop (linux, osx and windows) and
mobile (android and ios). On mobile it should use opengl es 2.0. On desktop we use GLFW and GLEw to abstract away the
differences between desktop os.

Current status
========================================================
Builds on linux mint.
Can read font and draw text. The result is kinda ruff still. There are artifacts.

See the image in this tweet for how it looks now:

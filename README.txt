This is suppose to be an example of opengl rendering text with freetype2 on both desktop (linux, osx and windows)
and mobile (android and ios). On mobile it should use opengl es 2.0. On desktop we use GLFW and GLEw to abstract away
the differences between desktop os.

Right now though all it is, is a example of setting up OpenGL to draw a blank black window on desktop (only tested on
linux mint 17, but hsould work on windows and osx if the dev environment is setup correctly) and android.R
